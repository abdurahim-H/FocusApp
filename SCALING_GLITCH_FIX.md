# WebGL Scaling Glitch Fix

## Issue Description
The 3D scene was experiencing a scaling/distortion glitch where the entire WebGL scene would gradually "balloon" outward for ~2 seconds, then shrink back, sometimes looping twice. This occurred after timer interactions, particularly when skipping focus/break sessions.

## Root Cause
The issue was in `/workspaces/website/js/camera-effects.js` in the `approachBlackHole()` and `escapeBlackHole()` functions. These functions were manipulating the camera's `aspect` ratio to create a "gravitational time dilation" visual effect:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (FIXED):
const distortionFactor = 1 - (progress * 0.3);
camera.aspect = (window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight) * distortionFactor;
camera.updateProjectionMatrix();
```

When the camera's aspect ratio is modified, it causes the entire WebGL viewport to stretch and distort, creating the "balloon" effect.

## Solution
Removed the aspect ratio manipulation while preserving other visual effects:

1. **Removed aspect ratio distortion** from `approachBlackHole()` function
2. **Removed aspect ratio distortion** from `escapeBlackHole()` function  
3. **Kept camera position movements** (zoom in/out effects)
4. **Kept redshift visual effects** (color tinting)
5. **Added explicit aspect ratio reset** to ensure clean state

## Trigger Points
The camera effects are triggered by:
- Starting a break session (automatic or manual)
- Skipping focus sessions (calls `completeSession()` → triggers break mode)
- Skipping break sessions (calls `completeSession()` → triggers focus mode)

## Test Steps to Verify Fix
1. Start a focus session
2. Skip the focus session (should trigger break mode)
3. Observe that the 3D scene remains stable without ballooning/stretching
4. Skip the break session (should trigger focus mode)
5. Verify no WebGL distortion occurs

## Files Modified
- `/workspaces/website/js/camera-effects.js` - Removed aspect ratio manipulation in camera effects

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - WebGL scaling glitch eliminated while preserving visual effects
